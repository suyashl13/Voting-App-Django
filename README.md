**Description:**
The Voting App with Real-time Updates is a dynamic web application built using Django and Websockets that enables users to create, participate in, and monitor live polls in real-time. This interactive and engaging platform allows users to cast their votes, view poll results instantly, and experience the excitement of seeing voting trends change dynamically as more votes are cast.

**Key Features:**

2. **Real-time Updates:** Leveraging the power of Websockets, the app provides real-time updates to users as votes are submitted. This feature ensures that participants can observe poll results in real-time without needing to refresh the page.

3. **Poll Creation and Management:** Registered users can create polls with multiple choices and set a time limit for the voting period. They also have the ability to close a poll before the set time if necessary.

4. **Secure Authentication:** The app incorporates robust user authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure the security and privacy of user data.

5. **Live Result Visualization:** As votes are cast, the app dynamically updates the poll's graphical representation, displaying the current voting trends with attractive charts and graphs.

6. **Real-time Notifications:** Users receive instant notifications when a new poll is created, ensuring they never miss out on participating in active polls.

7. **Poll Archives:** The app maintains a comprehensive archive of past polls, allowing users to review historical voting data and results.

8. **Mobile Responsive:** The app is designed to be mobile-responsive, ensuring a seamless and engaging experience across various devices and screen sizes.
